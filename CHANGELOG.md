# Below is original changelog from alexustas' last v1.5 release

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## v1.5 - 26/11/2017

Two new, fully modular and adjustable prop types were added: "Modular Toggle Switch" and "Modular Push Button".
With them, it is possible to create many different switches, both in form and in function.
They were based on real switches from Korry and Zodiac Electric,tumblers and buttons used by NASA in
Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, as well as switches used by Boeing.

- CAUTION! In the next major version of ASET PROPS old tumblers and buttons will be removed. All IVA makers are advised to switch to new, modular    buttons.

  * Added props that extend MechJeb autopilot function support.
  * Added props for Chatterer support.
  * Added props interacting with stock CommNet.
  * Added props for controlling docking and undocking.
  * Updated Mod Indicator Panel prop (thanks to NukeboyT).
  * Portable Timer prop can now show time to the currnt KAC alarm.
  * MFD40X20 now supports Astrogator.
  * All MFDs now use the JSISteerableCamera module.
  * MFD button backlight can now be toggled with the other props.
  * kOSMonitor finished and updated to use full functionality of JSISteerableCamera.
  * Life Support Monitor now supports TAC, USI-LS and Kerbalism.
  * Finished transitioning from the old JSIVariableLabel to the more advanced JSILable.
  * Added configs for Primitive_TRIANGLE_90 and Primitive_TRIANGLE_90_Beveled Fixes for many other props.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## v1.4 - 08/02/2017

- What is changed:

  * Almost all props were rebuilt due to the migration to Unity5, and also for the possibility to use new RPM features
  * The module JSIVariableAnimator is replaced by JSICallbackAnimator where it is possible to improve performance
  * All alphanumeric indicators now use the new improved and flexible module JSILabel
  * Most props now support the "COLOR_OVERRIDE" feature, which give all IVA-makers ample opportunity to customize their own IVA
  * The switches "SwitchRotary" are now modular, you can combine the switch model, the collider model and label using
      the MODEL{}module to create your variations of this  prop. 2 to 6 positions of the switch are supported.
  * Warning light indicator (TabloIndicator) was completely rebuilt, now all the labels are made with the module JSILabel,
      and texturesare used only for the indicator’s background
  * Some pages of MFD are improved, thanks to Nukeboyt
  * GPWS is now switched off by default
  * Extra optimization of textures is made
